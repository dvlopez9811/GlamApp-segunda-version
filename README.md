# Glam App - ProyectoAplicacionesMoviles

Glam is an Android developed App, created with the purpose of allowing beauty salons to connect with their clients, and make them able to see the salon's catalogue and profile, schedule an appointment, chat with the stylist, and rate the service once it has been provided.

The app counts on two different roles, one designed for the stylist, and one for the client.

It allows e-mail, google or facebook login.

All authentication data is stored with firebase, as well as the database used for the entire operation data.

As a client, once you are inside the app, you can watch the beauty salons near you, and filter them by the different services set they provide. You can also visualize how rated they are, the catalogue they have uploaded, add to your favorites, acess to google maps to see how to get there, and the most important, schedule your appointment for a certain service.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE:

In this repository, it's been included the google-services.json file, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO DO SO for security matters, it includes Google Maps and Firebase api keys, necessary to access these services in order to make the project work. Considering it uses an account that is no longer used and it has no security risks with this project, we have decided to let you have it in case you'd like to run the project without any issues.
